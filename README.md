store-toggle
============

  Enable or disable a key into a **[datastore](http://github.com/bredele/datastore)**-like object.

## Installation

  Install with [component(](http://component.io):

    $ component install bredele/store-toggle

  Install with [nodejs)](http://nodejs.org):

    $ npm install store-toggle


## API

```js
var toggle = require('store-toggle');

var store = new Store();
store.use(toggle);
```

  > a **datastore-like** object has at least a `set` handler to set an object's key with a value

### .enable(str)

  Set a datastore key to true.

```js
store.enable('admin');
store.get('admin');
// => true
```

### .diable(str)

  Set a datastore key to false.

```js
store.disable('admin');
store.get('admin');
// => false
```

### scope

  The default scope of store-toggle is the datastore itself. However you can change the scope as following:

```js
var store = new Store();
store.use(toggle, scope);

```

  > useful to use this plugin with modules that abstract datastore (like **[wall](http://github.com/bredele/wall)** for example).
